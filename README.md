## Homework 3 - creating a Password Generator in Javascript
* This is a prebuilt website that was lacking some Javascript for generating a password.
* The user is asked first for a range between 8-128 for the password length.
* Then, the user is asked if they would like lower case, upper case, or special characters (true/false).
* Next the logic is ran and randomly generates bits of information from within our arrays

### completed solution commit
I have finally completed this code. It was quite a challenge.
Next I will try to add some loops in case the user puts in unintended inputs.
