# Homework 3 - creating a Password Generator in Javascript
* This is a prebuilt website that was lacking some Javascript for generating a password.
* The user is asked first for a range between 8-128 for the password length.
* Then, the user is asked if they would like lower case, upper case, or special characters (true/false).
* Next the logic is ran and randomly generates bits of information from within our arrays

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page
```

## Completed solution commit
I have finally completed this code. It was quite a challenge.
Next I will try to add some loops in case the user puts in unintended inputs.
